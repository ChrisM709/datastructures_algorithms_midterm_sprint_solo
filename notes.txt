created the project structure to get a basic setup and plan how I will approach this project.
pushed the initial structure to GitHub.

------------------------------------------------

built a menu placeholder in Main.java to map out the project flow.
set maxUsers = 10 to keep the scope small; userCount starts at 0, so we begin with no users.
used a Scanner for menu input and a boolean flag to shut down the program when “Exit” is chosen.
added an “Invalid option” message for wrong inputs and left private methods at the bottom as placeholders for each feature.

------------------------------------------------

created the TaskList class next because users need to be able to add tasks to a list and it made sense to build that before anything else.
defined a private Node inner class that holds a Task and a reference to the next node. head points to the first node (or is null if empty) and size keeps track of how many tasks are in the list.
in addTask(), wrapped the new Task in a Node. if the list is empty, that node becomes head; otherwise traversed to the end and linked the new node there. after inserting, incremented size.
left placeholders for markCompleted(int position) and printTasks() to handle marking tasks done and printing them in order, and included getSize() so other parts of the program can easily check how many tasks are stored.
