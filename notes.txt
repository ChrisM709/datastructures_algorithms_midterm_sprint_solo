created the project structure to get a basic setup and plan how I will approach this project.  
pushed the initial structure to GitHub.

--------------------------------------------------

built a menu placeholder in Main.java to map out the project flow.  
set maxUsers = 10 to keep the scope small; userCount starts at 0, so we begin with no users.  
used a Scanner for menu input and a boolean flag to shut down the program when “Exit” is chosen.  
added an “Invalid option” message for wrong inputs and left private methods at the bottom as placeholders for each feature.
